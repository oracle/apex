# Sample Calendar

This application highlights the native calendaring capabilities of Oracle APEX. It features a monthly calendar with stylized daily tasks. The dates can be changed using drag and drop, which is all declarative and easily created using native APEX wizards. The calendar also features custom PL/SQL calendar control examples that show data in a vertical timeline, as well as a CSS Gantt chart also based on PL/SQL code.

Use this application to familiarize yourself with monthly calendars, drag and drop, monthly calendar styling, and custom PL/SQL driven calendar rendering techniques. The CSS required is included in the "HTML Header" attribute of each page. This makes the CSS easy to integrate into your own application.
